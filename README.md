# machLearn307

A machine learning algorithm in the Python Language created for Professor King's Data Mining course at College of the 
Holy Cross.  Changed the class to be a yes/no values instead of a numeric.  This required removing the G1, G2 and G3 
attributes and replacing them with enjoysClass.  The blank line at the end of the file is ESSENTIAL.
